### Question 4

```{r}
# We're doing this cumbersome method to put the formula in because I thought it was cool, but mostly because I'm lazy and didn't wanna type out all the control variables

# Get vector of all control variables for ease of use
x = c(grep('soil', names(burk_df), value = TRUE), grep('topo', names(burk_df), value = TRUE), grep('loc', names(burk_df), value = TRUE), "lnarea")

# Add village fixed effects
village = c(x, "village*year*fcrop")

# Function that outputs regression formula
formula_generator = function(y = "lnvalue", x){
  a = paste(y, "~", sep = " ")
  paste(a, paste(paste0(x),  collapse = " + "))
}

# Village fixed effects formula
village_formula = formula('lnvalue', village)

# Estimate first regression. 
village_reg = burk_df %>% lm(village_formula,.)
```


```{r}
# Now add household fixed effects
household = c(x, "hhn*year*fcrop")

# Formula
household_formula = formula('lnvalue', household)

household_reg = burk_df %>% lm(household_formula,.)

# Graph the density of residuals from each regression
resids = tibble(village = village_reg$residuals, household = household_reg$residuals)

# Graph residuals
resids |> 
  ggplot(aes(village)) +
  geom_density(col = 'red') +
  geom_density(aes(x = household), col = 'blue') + 
  xlab("Deviation from Predicted Yield") +  ylab("Kernel Density Estimate") +
  xlim(-5,5) + 
  ggtitle("Estimates of Yield Function Error Terms") + 
  cowplot::theme_cowplot()

# Test if distributions are different using KS test
with(resids, ks.test(village, household)) # Fail to reject
```

### Question 5

```{r}
# Add log of hh size of other plots to data
hhsize = c("lnhhsize", x)

# Formula
hhsize_formula = formula('lnvalue', hhsize)

# Run regression
other_reg = burk_df %>% lm(hhsize_formula,.)

summary(other_reg)
